# SYNAPSE Youth Wellness — “A Friend Powered by AI”

A friendly, empathetic AI that listens, adapts, and supports youth mental wellness with creative self-expression and a safety‑first escalation pathway — free for youth through credits and partnerships.

## Highlights
- Feels like a trusted friend: knows only what’s shared, adapts to preferred style, and responds with empathy.
- Personalized suggestions: music, movies, yoga, hydration nudges, and daily mood tracking.
- Creative outlets: private diary and drawing board to express feelings safely and privately.
- Safety-first escalation: detects high‑risk states and offers warm handoff to professionals or emergency resources.
- Free core access for youth via free tiers, credits, and partnerships.

## Why this matters
Mobile mental health apps can provide timely support, reduce costs, and combat stigma when designed ethically and safely, making accessible support especially valuable for youth populations.

## Safety and escalation
- Risk detection: identify risk cues, attempt online de‑escalation, and escalate externally when needed based on severity.
- Warm handover: connect to appropriate professionals or emergency services; monitor and follow up where possible.
- Continuous learning: review each escalation to improve safety policies and outcomes over time.

## Features
- Mood tracking with trends and simple check‑ins.
- AI chat that mirrors preferred tone and boundaries.
- Recommendations: playlists, comfort movies, short yoga flows, hydration prompts.
- Self‑expression: drawing board and private diary with local privacy controls.
- Crisis flow: in-app prompts to contact trained professionals or emergency resources when risk is detected.

## Live demo and screenshots
- Add a short Loom/GIF and screenshots here to showcase flows: onboarding, mood check, diary, drawing, and escalation prompt.
- Keep visuals near feature descriptions to speed comprehension for new contributors and reviewers.

## Getting started
1. Clone the repo and install dependencies per the chosen stack (e.g., React + Flask). Include .env.example for local setup.
2. Configure environment: AI provider keys, database URL, and optional vector store (redact secrets from commits).
3. Run dev servers: frontend and backend with hot reload; include commands and ports in this section for quick start.

## Configuration
- Auth: optional anonymous mode for youth privacy; link to auth provider settings if used.
- Persistence: database for moods, diaries; object storage for drawings; encryption at rest and in transit where applicable.
- Safety thresholds: configurable risk signal sensitivity and escalation routing; maintain a policy file with defaults.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome. Open an issue describing the change, link to any prior discussion, and submit a small, focused PR with tests where possible. Provide clear reproduction steps for bug reports and include screenshots for UI changes.

## Roadmap
- Short-term: offline-friendly journaling, multi-language prompts, and lightweight on-device models for low connectivity.
- Mid-term: clinician dashboard for warm handovers (opt-in), secure notes export, and school/NGO partnership kits.
- Long-term: research collaborations to evaluate outcomes, bias audits, and transparent model update notes.

## Privacy and data use
- Minimal data by default; the AI only knows what is shared during use, with clear controls to edit or delete entries.
- Transparent consent for any data used to improve models or features; opt-out paths documented in-app and here.
- Follow platform security best practices, including secret management, encryption in transit, and principle of least privilege.

## Accessibility
- Inclusive language, high-contrast themes, keyboard navigation, and captions/transcripts for multimedia content.
- Gradual disclosure in chat and UI to reduce cognitive load for younger users and those in distress.
